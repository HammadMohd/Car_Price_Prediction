# Car_Price_Prediction

“There is a huge demand of used cars in the Indian Market today. As sale of new car have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past year and is larger than the new car market now. Consider this: In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market. In fact, some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones.”
The goal of the case is as follows:
•	Perform EDA 
•	Build various Models to Predict the price (Build at least 2 models and compare the results and suggest which model works better) 
•	Insights/Suggestions 


# Dataset :
1.	Name : Name of the car which includes Brand name and Model name
2.	Location : The location in which the car is being sold or is available for purchase Cities.
3.	Year : Manufacturing year of the car
4.	Kilometers_driven : The total kilometers driven in the car by the previous owner(s) in KM.
5.	Fuel_Type : The type of fuel used by the car. (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, CNG, LPG)
6.	Transmission : The type of transmission used by the car.(Automatic / Manual)
7.	Owner_Type : Type of ownership
8.	Mileage : The standard mileage offered by the car company in kmpl or km/kg
9.	Engine : The displacement volume of the engine in CC.
10.	Power : The maximum power of the engine in bhp.
11.	Colour : The colour of the car.
12.	Seats : The number of seats in the car.
13.	No. of Doors : The number of doors the car have.
14.	New_Price : The price of a new car of the same model in INR Lakhs.(1 Lakh = 100, 000)
15.	Price : The price of the used car in INR Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100, 000)


# Insights and Suggestions

1.	 Feature Importance: The accuracy of Random Forest model suggests that features such as Year, Kilometers Driven, Mileage, and Engine have the most significant impact on car prices. Sellers should emphasize these aspects when listing their cars.

2.	Location Matters: The city where the car is sold affects its price. Consider regional variations in pricing when selling or purchasing a used car.

3.	Data Collection: Collect more data on vehicle conditions, service history, and additional features to improve prediction accuracy.

4.	Interactive Tools: Develop user-friendly tools for potential buyers and sellers to estimate car prices easily, incorporating the predictive model.

5.	Regular Updates: Continuously update the model with new data to adapt to changing market dynamics.



# Conclusion

The used car sales prediction project is crucial in the growing Indian pre-owned car market. Our analysis and model comparison indicate that the Random Forest Regressor offers the best price prediction accuracy.
