# Car_Price_Prediction

“There is a huge demand of used cars in the Indian Market today. As sale of new car have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past year and is larger than the new car market now. Consider this: In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market. In fact, some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones.”
The goal of the case is as follows:
•	Perform EDA 
•	Build various Models to Predict the price (Build at least 2 models and compare the results and suggest which model works better) 
•	Insights/Suggestions
